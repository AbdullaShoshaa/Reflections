Q:When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

A:when I want my project to be accessible from many devices.
  

Q:Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A:because sometime I do changes on local repo that I didn't already pushed to remote repo, so that would start merging probelms.

Q:Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?

A:fork is for cloning a repo to my github account, I would use it if I want to clone a repo from someone's account and use it but I want to give citations to him.
clone is used to create a copy of a repo to my local machine, I use it download a repo loclly.
branch is used to copy a branch into new branch, I would use it for doing changes to a project but don't want to affect the original branch. 

Q:What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

A:so it won't happen any conflicts when I do commits,so I need to up date the local repo and then do commits.

Q:How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

A:It would be a mess since all I used to do is send the code via email,
of course using git system; its hard to understand at the beggining but its awesome to use.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
