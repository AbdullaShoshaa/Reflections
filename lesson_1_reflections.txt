and cons si sometimes I may lose my recent work due to electricity loss or suddenly my device die for unknown reason.

Q:Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

A:because in many cases changing somthing in one file will affect other files so at this point it needs to also save the other commits in changed files.
